    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      This delicious recipe is perfect for morning breakfast. One recipe is
      never enough for the family.
    </p>
    <p>
      The pancakes are always moist and nutritious. I recommend these pancakes
      to be eaten with hot cinnamon syrup!

        In a large bowl, combine butter, egg, milk and apple. In a separate
        bowl, sift together flour, baking powder, cinnamon and sugar. Stir flour
        mixture into apple mixture, just until combined.

        Heat a lightly oiled griddle or frying pan over medium high heat. Pour
        or scoop the batter onto the griddle, using approximately 1/4 cup for
