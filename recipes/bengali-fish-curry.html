    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      A delicate Bengali fish curry. In India, the best parts of a fish are
      often reserved as a fillet and served grilled, broiled, or cooked
      alongside a fish stew or curry containing the less attractive portions of
      fish.
    </p>
    <p>
      The contrasting texture combination is worth trying at your dinner table.
